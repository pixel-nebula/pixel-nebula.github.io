## Game Information

This is a game thing called polytrack. Please read the following:

- This is an **offline game**. No open port required, yay.
- Don't embed the game; open it in a new tab to not break it.
- When importing files to your site:

## Installation and Setup

1. Download all the files.
2. If you're adding this to your site, rename `index.html` to something unique (e.g., `i-hate-people-leave-me-alone-also-minecraft-is-not-a-dead-game.html`).
3. If you renamed the HTML file, make sure to update any references to it in the JS files.
4. Place all files in your github repo.
5. Do not put files in a separate folder unless you're prepared to update all file paths and that is not fun so dont do it.

## Running the Game
